\section{Introduction}
Studying economics was a second choice in terms of degree choice. However it has turned to be as enlightening as I thought it would. Economics has helped me develop a new perspective on life that I otherwise would not have developed. Data Science is a new interest for me, specifically artificial intelligence, machine learning and how this may tie into quantum computing in the future. I'm unable to fathom the full scope of possibilities of data science however, I understand the usefulness of the study of big data, and hope to one day help solve major issues using the techniques learned in this class and other techniques picked up along the way. I am interested in a few different topics that may be suitable project candidates such as; how state marijuana legalization might affect migration of people across states, does raising minimum wage affect employment negatively in the short run or long run, or how do interest rates affect stock prices? Hopefully after graduation I can put these skills to use in various sectors to gain practice. I'm not sure of the positions available but the main goal is to gain experience, I'm also interested in returning to school to complete a PHD in economics, however it depends on the opportunities that present themselves.
